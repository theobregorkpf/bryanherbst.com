I'm Bryan Herbst, an Android developer for Target in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
I currently work on [Cartwheel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.target.socsav).

I primarily develop native Android applications. Previously I have worked on Drupal websites, done some raw PHP, a bit of .NET, Xamarin, JavaScript, and more. I never want to touch PHP or Xamarin again.


When I'm not busy working, I'm probably working with [FIRST robotics](http://firstinspires.org). I mentor the Irondale High School team ([FRC #2052, KnightKrawler](http://www.team2052.com)) and volunteer at FRC competitions.
