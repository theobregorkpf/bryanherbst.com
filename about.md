I'm Bryan Herbst, an Android developer at Target in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

When I'm not busy working, I'm probably working with [FIRST robotics](http://firstinspires.org). I mentor the Irondale High School team ([FRC #2052, KnightKrawler](http://www.team2052.com)) and volunteer at FRC competitions.
