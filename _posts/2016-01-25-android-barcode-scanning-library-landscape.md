There are a few different barcode scanning libraries out there right now and I will provide an overview of the three most popular options out there right now- ZXing, ZBar, and Google’s Mobile Vision API. This is a qualitative look at these libraries, so I won’t attempt to provide benchmarks.

What we have found is that there isn’t a single clear winner right now. Each library has at least one major drawback. Selecting a library for your project requires knowing the relative strengths and weakness of these libraries so you can pick the one that best fits your use case.
